# About Me

Hi! I'm **Aditya Kurniawan**, an Applied Scientist at [Inception](https://www.inceptioniai.org/) - [G42](https://g42.ai/), where I work on cutting-edge Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning research and applications. Currently, I'm heavily focused on the investment domain, building agentic LLM systems for sovereign funds in Abu Dhabi.

## What I Do

I specialize in:
- **Natural Language Processing** - Building and deploying language models for real-world applications
- **Agentic AI Systems** - Developing intelligent LLM-powered agents for complex investment workflows and decision-making
- **Machine Learning Research** - Exploring new approaches to text understanding and generation
- **Technical Leadership** - Bridging the gap between research and production systems
- **Quantitative Finance** - Currently diving deep into algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading (HFT) systems using low-level languages like C++

## My Journey

Previously, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at [Traveloka](https://www.traveloka.com/), where I led NLP initiatives for one of Southeast Asia's largest travel platforms. My work focused on building Indonesian language models and deploying ML systems at scale.

## Current Learning

I'm currently expanding into **quantitative finance**, with a particular focus on:
- **Algorithmic Trading Systems** - Designing and implementing automated trading strategies
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** - Building ultra-low latency trading systems
- **C++ for Finance** - Leveraging low-level programming for performance-critical financial applications
- **Market Microstructure** - Understanding how markets operate at the microsecond level

This journey combines my background in ML with the fascinating world of financial markets and systems programming.
